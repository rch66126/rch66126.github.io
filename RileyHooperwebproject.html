<p><img src="https://georgiadogs.com/images/2016/5/20/sanford16-gd-01.jpg"></p>
<p> This season the University of Georgia Bulldogs Football Team has shown incredible strength. The Dawgs have traveled all over the South from Baton Rouge, LA to Lexington, KY. Besides one devastating loss against LSU the Georgia Bulldogs remain an undefeated powerhouse in the SEC. The Bulldog Team is led by Coach Kirby Smart. Kirby Smart played football as a defensive back for Georgia from 1995-1998 and returned to coach at Georgia in 2016.</p> 
	<p>Although the Bulldogs graduated many important players at the end of last season, the 2018 team has proven that they are still just as much of a threat. With quarterbacks Jake Fromm and Justin Fields splitting playing time, the Georgia offense is an unstoppable force. Other playmakers for UGA include kicker Rodrigo Blankenship, corner back Deandre Baker, and running back D Andre Swift. </p>
	<p>The 2018 Bulldog Team is heading to the SEC Championship again this year in an attempt to defend their title. They are playing Alabama on December 1st in Atlanta at the Mercedes Benz Arena.</p>
